[Slots](domain.mdx#slots) of any type can now be ignored during a conversation.
To do so, specify the property `influence_conversation: false` for the slot.

```yaml
slot:
  a_slot:
    type: text
    influence_conversation: false
```

The property `influence_conversation` is set to `true` by default. See the
[documentation for slots](domain.mdx#slots) for more information.

A new slot type [`any`](domain.mdx#any-slot) was added. Slots of this type can store
any value. Slots of type `any` are always ignored during conversations.
