[Slots](domain.mdx#slots) of type [`unfeaturized`](domain.mdx#unfeaturized-slot) are
now deprecated and will be removed in Rasa Open Source 3.0. Instead you should use
the property `influence_conversation: false` for every slot type as described in the 
[migration guide](migration-guide.mdx#unfeaturized-slots).
